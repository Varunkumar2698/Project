I have resolved this issue, if anyone is still facing this issue follow steps below:

Firstly add your Runner.entitlements or Entitlements plist file in 'ios/Runner' folder

Update project.pbxproj file for code signing to use entitlement file

In cicd use xcode@5 task to archive without code signing, next manually code sign your Runner.app file

After archiving (Runner.app) you need to sign this with an entitlement file by using codesign command

Command:

codesign --entitlements -f -s -v <path to archive file (Runner.app)>

After codesign use xcodebuild archiveexport command for exporting your ipa file

This worked for me,
If you are facing any issues let me know
